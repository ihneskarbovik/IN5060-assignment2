* Only Op2 has beamforming?
* Trajectory slide
    * Add latitude/longitude axes
    * Add observation
    * Map is not very clearly visible, maybe make it less dark? âœ…
    * Add information about the data that is shown, e.g. campaign number âœ…
* Visuals
    * Add more references to our use case (for example Italian hand gestures) ðŸ¤Œ
