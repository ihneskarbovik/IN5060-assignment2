# IN5060-assignment2

## Comments from other presentations

* We need to say that the line in the middle of the violin plots are the median... we only have the quantiles
* Comment on the coverage on the OD driving being so good
* Don't have too much information in one plot... (I think we have that one covered though)
* Explain why a score is good or bad
* Show how much data we have in each scenario... Maybe see that everything has ish the equal amount of data. Choose campaigns and reson for why we chose specific campaigns maybe??
* Don't include many decimals, just round the results (there are tables that describe what good RSRP is online)
* Have some interpretation on the slides
* One slide that includes a table of the dataset and the amount of data per "group". More datapoints in one operator can indicate beamforming. Talk about the scewness
* Do we need to do a Dunn's test as well?
* More plots?
* Table with the significant tests instead of much text
* Consistency of colors ðŸ’…
* Do we take all the RSRP datapoints or just the best/closest one?
* Only Op2 has beamforming?
* Do we mention what features we use?
